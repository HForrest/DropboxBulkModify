# DropboxBulkCopy
A script that copys or deletes one folder into a variety of subfolders. Has commandline and GUI versions.

This script was designed with content managment and distribution via dropbox in mind. For example, you have a master folder filled with all of your content, and you share a folder to each individual who has access to part of your curriculum. This is not ideal, but this was an automated implementation of an organization's existing protocols.
